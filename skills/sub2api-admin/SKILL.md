name: sub2api-admin
description: Manage Sub2API admin APIs for accounts, redeem codes, groups, proxies, error passthrough rules, TLS fingerprint profiles, imports, exports, batch updates, and raw administrator API calls. Use when the user mentions Sub2API, admin API keys, account management, redeem code management, recharge codes, invitation codes, bulk account import/export, keeping or deleting accounts, refreshing accounts, clearing errors, CRS sync, or managing Sub2API backend settings through the admin API.

# Sub2API Admin

Use the bundled CLI instead of ad hoc `curl`. Run examples from this skill directory.

```bash
export SUB2API_BASE_URL='https://your-sub2api-host'
export SUB2API_ADMIN_API_KEY='<admin api key>'
# Or, when the deployment uses admin JWT login instead of an admin API key:
# export SUB2API_JWT='<admin access_token>'
node scripts/sub2api-admin.js accounts list
```

For all commands and payload examples, read [references/admin-cli.md](references/admin-cli.md).

## Mixed Proxy Directory

The existing `GET /api/v1/admin/proxies` and `GET /api/v1/admin/proxies/all` default to a mixed directory of real proxies and virtual proxy IP groups; no new route is needed. A real proxy has `id > 0` and `binding_type=proxy`. A group row has `id=-groupID`, `binding_type=proxy_ip_group`, and positive `proxy_ip_group_id`. Treat the group row only as an account-binding choice, never as a real proxy for test, update, delete, or outbound use. The admin proxy DTO can contain real proxy credentials; do not print raw list output in chat.

On account create/update, prefer positive `proxy_ip_group_id` for OpenAI OAuth/Setup Token. Legacy `proxy_id > 0` remains a real proxy ID and must be validated as such; negative `proxy_id` is only a compatibility input for a virtual group row and must be normalized into the positive group field. `proxy_id=0` explicitly clears the real-proxy binding; omission on update means unchanged. Do not apply negative-ID compatibility to OAuth authorization, proxy CRUD, or bulk proxy operations. See [admin-cli.md](references/admin-cli.md) for the contract and implementation status.

## Workflow

1. Reuse `SUB2API_BASE_URL` and either `SUB2API_ADMIN_API_KEY` or `SUB2API_JWT` from the environment.
2. Run read-only commands first: `accounts list`, `accounts get <id>`, `groups all`, or `proxies all`.
3. Before destructive or bulk writes, print the target account names and IDs.
4. Execute the write command only after the target set is clear.
5. Run a follow-up read command to verify the result.

## Common Commands

```bash
node scripts/sub2api-admin.js accounts list --page-size 20
node scripts/sub2api-admin.js accounts get 40
node scripts/sub2api-admin.js accounts usage 40
node scripts/sub2api-admin.js accounts set-schedulable 40 true
node scripts/sub2api-admin.js accounts bulk-update --ids 40,39 --json '{"concurrency":10}'
node scripts/sub2api-admin.js redeem-codes list --page-size 20
node scripts/sub2api-admin.js redeem-codes generate --json '{"count":1,"type":"balance","value":10}' --idempotency-key redeem-$(date +%s)
node scripts/sub2api-admin.js redeem-codes create-and-redeem --json '{"code":"order_123","type":"balance","value":10,"user_id":123}' --idempotency-key order-123
node scripts/sub2api-admin.js error-rules list
node scripts/sub2api-admin.js tls-profiles list
```

## Safety Notes

- Authentication uses `x-api-key` from `SUB2API_ADMIN_API_KEY` first, then falls back to `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` from `SUB2API_JWT`.
- If the API returns `INVALID_ADMIN_KEY`, ask the user to regenerate the admin API key. If using JWT, log in as an admin user and copy the `access_token` from `POST /api/v1/auth/login`.
- `accounts export` includes credentials and tokens. Prefer `--file` and avoid printing exports in chat.
- Redeem code create/redeem commands should use `--idempotency-key` for payment or recharge workflows.
- For uncertain or newly added backend APIs, use `api <METHOD> <admin-path>` after a read-only check.
